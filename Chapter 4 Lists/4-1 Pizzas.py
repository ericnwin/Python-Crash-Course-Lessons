# Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
# pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
# • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
# instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should
# have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni
# pizza.
# • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states
# how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines
# about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as
# I really love pizza!
