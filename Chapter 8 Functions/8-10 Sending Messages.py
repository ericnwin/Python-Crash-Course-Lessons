'''
8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9.
Write a function called send_messages() that prints each text message and
moves each message to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. After
calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were
moved correctly.
